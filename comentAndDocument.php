                    from both accounts students, staffs. He is a supper accessor of the platform.
                    Staff - they are the second root who handle many activities from the platform. Beyond 
                    of root roof, they take the same right to edit, delete, mark students for their pstudentresence and
                    edit if there is a raisonable raison to mark as present. They have access to their personal account
                    and are granted to do the research and send report from the dashboard to students by email.
                    Student - The principal user of the platform are students. They can do many operations
                    but their power is limited for many raisons:
                       -  Avoid student to mark themselve
                       -  Prevent the crash of the platform
                       -  Record right data and respect anonymity.
